Simple portfolio template created on MS VsCode.

Valid to say: this is my first true contact with HTML/CSS/JS out of the "basic" logic course, still lots of room for improvement, some functions need work and the style is not as I would do it if I had more time, but the main objectives of the project were accomplished:

- Home page with parallax images
- Functioning pages
- Functioning theme switching button
- Built in contact form*

*The contact form will not work as it is.

Shout out to my friend Felipe Pacelli for helping me with some aspects of this project.
