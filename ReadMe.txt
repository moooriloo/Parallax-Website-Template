
<h2>Simple portfolio template created on MS VsCode.</h2>
Valid to say: this is my first true contact with HTML/CSS/JS out of the "basic" logic course, still lots of room for improvement, some functions need work and also are not styled as I would do them but the main objectives of the project were accomplished:

- Home page with parallax images
- Functioning pages
- Functioning theme switching button
- Built in contact form

Shout out to my friend Felipe Pacelli for helping me with some aspects of this project.
